   * Run the main() method from your IDE when you want to run your code
   *
   * Task 1 : Learn textFile(), mapToPair(), reduceByKey(), and saveAsTextFile()
   *   Use textFile(), mapToPair(), and reduceByKey() to implement a Spark application that reads in all of words from the bible
   *   and counts how many times that word occurs. You will also need to understand what an RDD is.
   *   Use the below references to learn about RDD, textFile(), mapToPair(), and reduceByKey()
   *       RDD: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#resilient-distributed-datasets-rdds
   *            https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_spark/apache_spark_rdd.htm
   *       textFile(): http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#external-datasets
   *       mapToPair(): http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#working-with-key-value-pairs
   *       reduceByKey(): http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#transformations
   *       saveAsTextFile(): http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#actions
   *
   *   Below is what the input dataset looks like:
   *     in
   *     the
   *     beginning
   *     god
   *     created
   *     the
   *     heavens
   *
   *   When using the textFile(input) method from the SparkContext, spark will read in all of the files from the "input" directory.
   *   Spark will create an RDD[String] where each element of the RDD is one line of the file. In other words, for reading this dataset Spark
   *   will create a RDD where each element is one word.
   *
   *   Use the saveAsTextFile(output) method on the RDD to save your result. The output should be in this format: <word>\t<count>.
   *   Note that you will have to use a map() function in the end of the Spark application  to transform the elements in your RDD
   *   to match this format <word>\t<count>.
   *
   *   Below is an example of what the output format should look like:
   *     shall	9838
   *     unto	8997
   *     lord	7830
   *     thou	5474
   *     thy	4600
   *     god	4442
   *
   * Task 2: Learn sortByKey()
   *
   *   Improve your Spark Application by sorting your dataset where the most common word appears on the top. To do this
   *   look into using Spark's PairRDD method sortByKey(). Note that sortByKey() is only available to PairRDDs
   *
   *   See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#transformations
   *
   *   Tip: Scala's Tuple2 has a swap() function which returns a Tuple2 where the first and second values in the tuple are swapped
   *     ("shall", 9838).swap equals (9838, "shall")
   *
   *
   * Task 3: Learn filter() and Broadcast variables
   *   Use filter() and Broadcast variables to remove common stop words from the result
   *
   *   Notice how words that occur the most are the common stop words such as "the", "and", "of", etc. For this next task
   *   improve your Spark Application further by removing these common stop words before doing a word count. A very basic stop words
   *   dataset has been provided, and its directory location has been passed in as a parameter to this method. This stop words dataset
   *   is basic, and you are welcome to add other words if you wish e.g. "thee", "thou", etc.
   *
   *   Read all the stop words into a set, then use that set to create a Broadcast variable. Using a Broadcast variable allows spark to efficiently
   *   transfer large data to each executor in the cluster. It is much better to send large data to worker nodes via Broadcast variable, then it is
   *   to send the data without a Broadcast variable.
   *     See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#broadcast-variables
   *       (using broadcast variables will not make any difference locally, but can make a huge difference when you run on a cluster with many nodes).
   *
   *   Once the Broadcast variable is setup just reference it in the anonymous function passed to filter().
   *     JavaRDD<String> rdd = // capture all the bible words in a rdd
   *     Set<String> set = // retrieve the stop words
   *     Broadcast<Set<String>> broadcast = sc.broadcast(set)
   *     rdd.filter(word -> {
   *       broadcast.value() // use broadcast variable here
   *     })
   *   In this example above, spark will know to send the broadcast variable to the workers that run the filter function, since we referenced the
   *   broadcast variable in the anonymous function.
   *
   *   Tip: An easy way to read in the stop words would be to use textFile(stopWordsIn).collect(). However you can choose to read in the
   *   stop words using Java libraries if you wish.
   *
   * @param sc configured SparkContext to run locally
   * @param input bible words input directory
   * @param stopWordsIn stop words input directory
   * @param output result output directory

  private static void run(final JavaSparkContext sc, final String input, final String stopWordsIn, final String output) {

    JavaRDD<String> inputWords = sc.textFile(input);
    JavaRDD<String> rdd = sc.textFile(stopWordsIn);
    Set<String> stopWords = new HashSet(rdd.collect());
    Broadcast<Set<String>> broadcast = sc.broadcast(stopWords);
    JavaRDD<String> bibleWords = inputWords.filter(word -> { return !broadcast.value().contains(word); });  //filter out all the words in the stopWords List
    JavaPairRDD<String, Integer> pairs = bibleWords.mapToPair(s -> new Tuple2(s, 1));
    JavaPairRDD<String, Integer> counts = pairs.reduceByKey((a, b) -> a + b);
    JavaPairRDD<String, Integer> sorted = counts.mapToPair(x -> x.swap()).sortByKey(false).mapToPair(x -> x.swap());  //sort the words count list by the numbers it appears (sort by value)
    sorted.saveAsTextFile(output);
